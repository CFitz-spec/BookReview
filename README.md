This is my BookReview website

As part of the UDEMY web Developer course. 
This APP uses

Express

Body-parser

Pg

Axios (Although, doesn't actually need to!! initally thought I would, but didn't use in the end)

Dotenv for the .env 

This time around the focus was on using postgres SQL. Using PGAdmin to send and retrieve data from the Database for persistant storage.
I also wanted to find out about .env files. As my last project proved difficult to get them right with 

What I found easy here was:

Using API calls 

Finally understand .env files work. This took a while but was easy in the end. 

Passing data from front end to back end. 

Using EJS

Creating headers and footers

Back end server work. This was quite easy and straightforward. I defo spent more time with the front end.

What I had to learn about:

Queries using postgres

How .env files work

CSS

Creating a filter by score and most recent -- this was fun to learn about and somewhat simple to do

What I need to improve on:

CSS -- this is becoming a time sink and something I find difficult. Although I didn't use Bootstrap this time around and I'm somewhat happy with how things look. 
I've still a long way to go with this

DataBase work -- I kept running into snags and this webapp has some bugs in, Although I've learnt quite a lot about it. I feel like I've much more to learn.
Joining and assigning foreign keys and such. 

Using gitHub from the CML. I find it strange, and I feel like I may have configured this incorrectly. I find just dragging and dropping into the repositories much easier and faster. 
Although I understand why I need to do it this way (job, ease of access, expectation/norms)

Something I think worked well:

I added the option to confirm deletion which seems really useful for future projects. 

I initially went with a video overlay for the front page. However, I didn't like it. Although now I know how to do it. 

I feel as though I'm understanding containers and classes better now. In the past I gave everything a div class and it become really hard to keep track.
Now I feel like I'm understanding my selectors better and having an easier time of it. 

If I could start again: 
I would spend more time starting the DB table. I feel like I rush this part and came to regret it later. I had an issue with primary and foreign keys with the different tables.
I feel like I didn't really need to have two tables. As after the fact I only really needed the ISBN number, Review blog and review score.
As the ISBN is unique, I could of used this for getting the book title/amazon api call and as id. I think this could of solved my bug.

All of these reviews were AI-generated. In the interests of time, this seemed the smartest idea.
